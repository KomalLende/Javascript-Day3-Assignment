//Assignment day 3

//Question 2 : 

//Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples


/*Difference between var and let in JavaScript
var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
An example will clarify the difference even better


Example of var:

Input:
console.log(x);
var x=5;
console.log(x);

Output:
undefined
5

Example of let:

Input:
console.log(x);
let x=5;
console.log(x);

Output:
Error

//Program :

<html> 
  
<body> 
    <script> 
        document.write("<br/>"); 
        document.write("<br/>"); 
        // calling x after definition 
        var x = 5; 
        document.write(x, "\n"); 
  
        // calling y after definition  
        let y = 10; 
        document.write(y, "\n"); 
  
        // calling var z before definition will return undefined 
        document.write(z, "\n"); 
        var z = 2; 
  
        // calling let a before definition will give error 
        document.write(a); 
        let a = 3; 
    </script> 
</body> 
  
</html>
