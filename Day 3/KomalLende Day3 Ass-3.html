//Question 3 : 

//Write a brief intro on available datatypes in javascript


/*Javascript Data Types :-

JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

Primitive data type
Non-primitive (reference) data type
JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:

var a=40;//holding number  
var b="Rahul";//holding string  

A] JavaScript primitive data types :

There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

1. String :
A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.

let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;

2. Boolean : 
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

For instance:

let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

3. number
The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

let n = 123;
n = 12.345;

4.The “null” value : 
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

let age = null;
In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.

It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

The code above states that age is unknown.

5.The “undefined” value :

The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.

The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"
Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable:

let age = 100;

// change the value to undefined
age = undefined;

alert(age); // "undefined


B] JavaScript non-primitive data types :-

The non-primitive data types are as follows:

Data Type	-    Description
Object	    -    represents instance through which we can access members
Array	    -    represents group of similar values
RegExp	    -    represents regular expression*/
